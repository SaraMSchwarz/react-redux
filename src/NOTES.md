//STORE -> we created a store that holds all of our state
//we dispatch an action (a function that returns an action, such as INCREMENT)
//then reducer looks at which action was dispatched. Based on the name
//it returns a piece of state (in this case 0).
//Redux is good for LARGE projects.

//ACTION increment describes what you want to do, action is a function that returns an object



//REDUCER how actions transform state


//display in console

//DISPATCH
